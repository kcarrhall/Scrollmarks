# Scrollmarks
Scrollmarks is a Chrome Extension that saves the scroll position for the currently opened tab. When that url is loaded again, the extension will attempt to scroll to the saved location. 

Scrollmarks can keep track of multiple pages, but only keeps track of one mark per page. 

It does not work with all webpages.
