Scrollmarks is a Chrome Extension remembers your scroll position on a page. Click the Scrollmarks button & when that url is loaded again, the extension will try to scroll to the saved scroll position. 

Scrollmarks can keep track of multiple pages, but only keeps track of one mark per page. 

It does not work with all webpages.
